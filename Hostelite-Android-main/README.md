# FiiitdBack
A hostel management application for iiitd (MobileComputing  final project), designed to streamline student complaints and track their entry and exit times directly to the administration. Utilizing Jetpack Compose Libraries for its interface, Firebase serves as the backend while incorporating the Google Maps API to monitor the current location of hostel residents.

There are two types of Views for this app, signifying the two types of users:
   
   - Views for Students
   - Views for Hostel Administration

For students, the integrated features will include:

   - Submitting issues to the administration.
   - Recording entry (utilizing location tracking).
   - Logging exit times.
   - Viewing daily entry/exit records.
   - Receiving alerts if outside the facility beyond a designated time, with prompts to provide explanations to the administration.
   - Accessing notices posted by the hostel administration.
   - Updating personal profile details.

For administration, the integrated features will include:

   - Reviewing complaints submitted by hostel residents, categorizing them as sorted, pending, or rejected.
   - Monitoring alerts from residents outside the premises after a designated time.
   - Accessing entry/exit reports for the entire hostel on specific dates.
   - Publishing notices for hostel residents to read.
   - Updating personal profile details.
